# rippit


## Description
Our project that we created for our Group Project #2 is a Fullstack forum. We wanted to create a forum that anyone and everyone could be a part of, and express themselves on. You are able to Create an account, and/or Log-In and browse through existing Forums, Posts within those Forums, and see Comments that have been made on those posts. Along with being able to view all of those things, you will also be able to Create your own Forum, Create posts within any Forum, and leave Comments on any Post, as well as upvoting Posts that you like. All in all the project itself went well with very few setbacks once we were able to get our communication in order. Everybody that worked on something, and committed something were all very valuable, and in the end we were able to have a fully functioning forum hosted on Heroku.
